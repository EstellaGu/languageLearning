在英语句子中，本来应该由名词充当的主语、宾语、表语和同位语，有一个句子来充当，这个句子就叫名词性从句。

判断下列句子中名词的功能：

1. The book is my brother’s.
2. I gave my son a dictionary.
3. What I want is a pair of shoes.
4. The book, ‘A Brief History of Time’, was written by Stephen Hawking, a great scientist.

判断下列句子是否含名词性从句，如是，是什么类型的名词性从句：

1. *Whether his proposal is practical or not* remains to be seen.                                                            主语从句

3. We haven’t decided *when we should start*.                                                                                       宾语从句
4. My suggestion is *that you set out early tomorrow*.                                                                           表语从句
5. News came *that we won the relay race*.                                                                                              同位语从句

7. That’s the news **that made me excited**.                                                                                           定语从句
8. **Where the news spread**, people burst out cheering.                                                                     地点状语从句
9. *That he will not attend the meeting* worries us.                                                                                   主语从句 



## 主语从句

That I can pay back the help people give me makes me happy.

Whether he’ll be able to come is not yet known.

Why they have not left yet is not clear so far.

It was good news that everyone got back safely.

### 连接词that

**在从句中无意义，不作任何成分，只是起引导作用，不能省略**

*That he will succeed* is certain.

I missed such a good chance. It is a pity. 将这两句话合并：

*That I missed such a good chance* is a pity. = It(形式主语) is a pity *that I missed such a good chance*.

 *That we beated them* made us excited.

### 连接词what

**在主宾表从句中作主宾表**

*What has happened* has nothing to do with me.                        What在主语从句中作主语

*What he needs most* is more time.                                                What在主语从句中作宾语

*What I saw* is completely different from what I heard.           What在主语从句中作宾语

比较一下：

众所周知，钓鱼岛属于中国。

It is known to all that the Diaoyu islands belong to China.

What is known to all is that the Diaoyu islands belong to China.

As is known to all, the Diaoyu islands belong to China.

### 连接词whether(不用if), when, where, why, how

**在从句中作状语**

Whether he’ll attend the meeting or not doesn’t make any difference.

When he will go there is not known.

When the museum will be open to the public hasn’t been decided yet.

How Bill Gates succeeded is known to us all.

Where he hid the money is to be found out.

When and where the women teachers will go shopping **hasn't** been decided yet.

When the teachers in our school will have a spring outing and where we will go for travel **haven't** been decided yet.

### 连接词wh-ever

whoever, wherever, however, whenever……

Whoever breaks the law should be punished.

Wherever they go should be under observation.

Please give it to whoever needs it.

比较：What I want to know is ***who*** is responsible for the project.

who引导名词性从句有疑问意义。

以下三句是状语从句，可与no matter who/where互换

Whoever|No matter who breaks the law, he should be punished.

Wherever|No matter where they go, they should be under observation.

Whoever|No matter who needs it, please give it to him.

### 用it作形式主语：

为避免主语冗长，句子头重脚轻，经常用it作形式主语

找出下列三句话中真正的主语：

1. It’s certain that he will succeed.
2. It is not known whether he will go there.
3. It is to be found out where he hid the money.

### 常用句型：

1. It is +adj. that….

   It is necessary/important/strange/natural/surprising/obvious/likely…. that….

   It is important that you keep warm.

2. It is +分词 that….

   It’s said/reported/believed/thought/ suggested/hoped…. that….

   It’s said that there was a murder last night.

3. It is +n. that….

   It is common sense/a surprise/a fact/a pity/a shame/no wonder…. that….

   It is no wonder that he got a cold.

4. It + 不及物动词 that….

   It appears/seems that….  It seems that you are tired out.

   It happened that…. 碰巧

   It occurred to me that…. 我突然想起

   It proved that…. 证明是

   It turned out that…. 结果是

   It (doesn’t) matter that…. ……(不)很重要

用it作形式主语，翻译句子：

1. 你没早点来真是遗憾

   It is a pity that you didn't come earlier.

2. 她头发变白使她担忧

   It worries her that her hair is turning grey.

3. 他是否加入我们关系不大

   It doesn't matter whether he will join us.

4. 我们什么时候回来还没决定

   It hasn't been decided when we will come back.



## 宾语从句

### 连接词

1. that
2. whether/if
3. what, who, which, when, where, why, how, wh-ever

1. He believes that his dream will come true one day.

2. It all depends on whether he will support us.

3. He based his conclusion on what he read from the letter.

4. Jane suggested that we should set off at 6 a.m.

7. 老师说这片课文很重要，我们应该记住。

   The teacher said the article was important and **that(两个宾语从句并列，第二从句的that不能省略)** we should remember it.

8. 老师告诉我们光是沿直线运行的。

   The teacher told us light **travels(客观事实永远用一般现在时)** straight.

### 使用规则

1. 主句如果是过去时，从句应该是过去的某种时态。但客观事实、真理、自然规律等，从句谓语通常用一般现在时

2. 从句须按陈述句的语序。

3. 谓语动词后跟多个宾语从句时，只能省略第一个that，第二个开始的that不能省略。

4. if和whether的选用：

   1. 介词后只用whether
   2. 只有whether后面能加动词不定式，whether to do
   3. 只有whether可以和or/or not搭配，whether or not

   if/whether选词填空

   1. I asked her **if|whether** she had a bike.
   2. We’re worried about **whether** he is safe.
   3. I don’t know **if|whether** he is safe.
   4. I don’t know **whether** or not he is well.
   5. I don’t know **whether** to go.
   6. **Whether** we will hold a party in the open air tomorrow depends on the weather.

5. 一些及物动词make, find, see, consider等的宾语从句，常用it作形式宾语，而把宾语从句放在宾补之后，此时that一般不省略。

   We find it necessary **that** we practice speaking English every day.

   I made it clear **that** I was determined to carry out the plan.



## 表语从句

The truth is that the fog is too thick for the bus to run that far.

My question is whether Polly can find her way home.

The problem is how Polly is going to find us in the crowd.

作用：对主语进行解释说明

### 连接词

各个连接词和主语、宾语从句都是一样的

1. that/whether/as if/as though
2. who/whom/whose/which/what
3. when/where/why/how/because

**注意一个句型：The reason (why …/for…) is/was that…**

1. The reason **why** we didn’t trust him is **that** he often lies.
2. The reason  **that|which|/** he gave for his absence was **that** he was ill.

reason后面的表语从句只能用that引导，不能用why引导。



## 同位语从句

### 作用

一般在一些抽象名词(idea, belief, fact, truth, problem, news等)后面，对名词作进一步解释说明，同谓语从句常用that引导或用连接副词when/where/why/how/whether引导

1. The idea that computers can recognize human voices surprised many people.
2. Word came that Napoleo himself was coming to inspect them.
3. Sydney kept his promise that he would always do anything he could for Lucie to make sure of her happiness.

### 应用

用同位语从句改写下列句子：

1. Two thirds of the girls in Britain are on a diet. The fact worries their parents and teachers a lot.

   The fact that two thirds of the girls in Britain are on a diet worries their parents and teachers a lot.

2. The Queen of England was on a three-day visit in China. We heard the news last night.

   We heard the news that the Queen of England was on a three-day visit in China last night.

用that/whether/where/how填空

1. I have no idea **where** he comes from.
2. He can’t answer the question **how** he got the money.
3. He gave us a suggestion **that** we should get up earlier and take more exercise.
4. I have no doubt **that** he will win.
5. I have some doubt **whether** he will win.

### should虚拟

名词suggestion, proposal, advice, request, requirement, demand等后面的同位语从句要用should虚拟。

He gave me a suggestion **that I should stay calm**.

### 同位语从句与定语从句的区别

1. 句子完整性不同

   The news **that they had won the game** soon spread over the school. (同位语从句是完整的句子)

   The news **(that) you told me yesterday** was really disappointing. (定语从句是不完整的句子)

2. 连接词that的作用不用

   - 同位语从句中that的作用
     - 引导的从句与前面的名词是同位关系，解释其内容
     - 只引导从句，不做任何成分
     - 无具体含义，且不可省略

   - 定语从句that的作用：
     - 引导的从句修饰前面的名词
     - 充当从句的主、宾、表语
     - 充当从句的宾语时可省略



## 名词性从句的一些注意点

### 名词性从句的语序——陈述语序

Could you tell me **where he lives**?

### Whether/if的区别

1. 主语从句、表语从句、同位语从句主能用whether引导，不能用if
2. 介词后只用whether
3. 只有whether能与to do连用， whether to do
4. 只有whether能与or或or not连用，whether or not

### that的省略与保留

1. 在主+谓+it(形式宾语)+宾补+that句型中，that不能省略

   We must make it clear **that** we mean what we say.

2. 由连词and连接的两个有that引导的宾语从句中，第二个that不省略

   He told me **(that)** he would come and **that** he would come on time.

3. 主语从句、表语从句、同位语从句中that不能省略

   **That** they are good at English is known to us all.

4. 当that引导的从句作介词的宾语时，that不可省略

   The reason lies in **that** she works harder than the others do.

   I know nothing about him except **that** he is a novelist.

5. 当that宾语从句中状语部分位于从句前部时，that不可省略

   Tell him **that** if he comes tomorrow, please call me.

6. 当that前有插入语时，that不能省略

   Tom didn’t know, I’m sure, **that** his sister was going to Japan.

7.  that和what的区别

   that在名词性从句中不作成分，无意义，一般不省略(动词的宾语从句的that可以省略)，what在名词性从句中作成分，有意义，一般作主语、宾语、表语。

#### 用that或what填空：

1. **What** we haven’t got is better than **what** we’ve got.
2. **What** we need is **that** we should work much harder.
3. **What** all the inventions have in common is **that** they all succeed.
