    Anyone who breaks the rules will be punished.

## 介词+关系代词

### 规则描述

关系代词做介词的宾语时，如果不是固定词组，可以把介词置于关系代词前，此时关系代词只能用whom(指人)和which(指物)。

e.g. 

1. Do you know the boy **who|whom|that|/ ** she was talking to? 

   Do you know the boy to **whom** she was talking?

2. The pencil **which|that|/** he was writing with suddenly broke.

   The pencil with **which** he was writing suddenly broke.

注：含有介词的固定动词短语一般不拆开，介词仍放在短语动词的后面。如：look for, look after, take care of

e.g. 

This is the watch **which|that|/** I am looking for.

### 介词选用的原则

1. 根据定语从句中谓语动词的搭配习惯来决定。如：
   1. This is the book **on** which I spent 8 yuan.
   2. This is the book **for** which I paid 8 yuan.

2. 根据先行词的搭配习惯来决定
   1. I remember the day **on** which I joined the League.
   2.  I remember the days **during** which I worked as a volunteer teacher in the village. 
   3. I remember the month **in** which I studied in the British high school.

### 和of搭配，指代范围

“介词+关系代词”前或后还可以有some, any, none, all, both, neither, many, most, each, few 等代词或者数词，或形容词最高级，如the highest, the largest等，常和of搭配，指代范围。

1. He loves his parents deeply, **both of whom** are very kind to him.
2. In the basket there are quite many apples, **some of which** have gone bad.
3. There are forty students in our class in all, **most of whom** are from big cities.
4.  Up to now, he has written ten stories, **three of which** are about country life.
5. The boy has many dreams, **the biggest of which** is to own a company of his own. 

### whose+n.=the+n.+of which=of which+the+n.

1. We found a house, whose roof was destroyed in the storm. 
2. We found a house, the roof of which was destroyed in the storm.
3. We found a house, of which the roof was destroyed in the storm.

### the way

以the way为先行词的定语从句通常由in which或that引导，而且通常可以省略。

1. The way in which/that he handles the problem was surprising.

    =The way he handles the problem was surprising.

2. I don’t like the way ______ they laugh at her.

## 关系副词

定语从句中的关系副词有三个：where, why, when. 它们不仅要连接主从句，还要在从句中担当时间，地点和原因状语。例句：

1. Do you remember the day when we first met?
2. The factory where he works is in the west of the city.
3. Is this the reason ______ he is always late for school?

### 关系副词=介词+which

1. Do you remember the day on which we first met?

2. Do you remember the year when we both worked on the farm?

   = Do you remember the year **in which** we both worked on the farm?

3. The factory where he worked is in the west of the city.

   = The factory **in which** he worked is in the west of the city.

4. Is this the reason why he was late?

   = Is this the reason **for which** he was late?

### 关系副词和关系代词的区别

1. 关系代词在从句中担任主语、宾语、表语、定语
2. 关系副词在从句中担任时间、地点、原因状语

例句：

1. The reason **why** he didn’t go to school is that he was ill.

   The reason **which|that|/** he gave us just now is unbelievable.

2. I will never forget the day **when** we visited the museum?

   I will never forget the day **which|that|/** we spent together.

## 定语从句中几个易混淆问题

### 先行词缺失

Is that flat **the one** you once lived in?

Is this the flat **which|that|/** you once lived in?

### 主谓一致

1. Those who **have** finished may leave the classroom now.

   The woman who **teaches** us English is Jenny.

2. She is the only one of the ladies who **wears** a gown.

   She is one of the ladies who **wear** gowns.

###  定语从句和并列句

1. He has three sisters, none of **whom** is a doctor.

2. He has three sisters, but none of **them** is a doctor.

3. He has three sisters; **None** are doctors.

## 模糊概念的关系副词where

中文翻译为“在……之中”

1. Basketball is a kind of sport **where** cooperation matters more than skills.

2. Can you think of a situation **where** the word can be used?

3. He has already reached a point in his career **where** he should think about what to do next.

经常和where搭配的先行词还有：condition, case

## 以as引导的定语从句

as也可以引导定语从句，条件是先行词被such, the same, as, so修饰或先行词本身是the same, such. as在从句中做主语、宾语或表语

1. He is not such a man as only thinks of himself.

2. I would like to use the same pen as I used yesterday.

   思考：I would like to use the same pen that I used yesterday.

3. Such problems as are often mentioned should be solved.

4. I will read as many books as are required.

5. It is so big a stone as no one can lift.

    比较：It is so big a stone that no one can lift it.

## 非限制性定语从句

His mother, whom he loved dearly, went abroad.

This machine, which he has looked after for many years, is still working perfectly.

The family, who lived upstairs, are fond of music.

He seems not to have grasped what I meant, which greatly upsets me.

#### 特点

1. 非限制性定语从句与主句之间通常用逗号分开。
2. 非限制性定语从句是对先行词的补充或说明，去掉它也不会影响主句的意思。限制性定语从句与先行词关系密切，是先行词不可缺少的部分，如果去掉它，主句意思往往不明确。
3. 非限制性定语从句既可以修饰先行词又可以修饰整个主句。
4. 不可以用that引导，且关系代词不可以省略。

#### AS

As也可以作为关系代词引导非限制性定语从句，意为“正如”，常和动词know, expect, think, see 等动词连用。只修饰整个句子，但位置灵活，句首，句中，句末都可以放

1. The Diaoyu island is part of China, as we all know.
2. The Diaoyu island, as we all know, is part of China.
3. As is known to all, the Diaoyu island is part of China.
4. She is a teacher, as is clear from her manner.
5. She is an energetic and diligent girl, as is described in the composition.
6.
