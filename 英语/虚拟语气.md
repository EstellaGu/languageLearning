# 虚拟语气

定义：虚拟语气表示动作或状态不是客观存在的事实，而是说话人的主管愿望、假设、建议等。

## if的虚拟

### 句型公式

现在：If… did/were …., ……would/should/could/might do

过去：If… had done…., ……would/should/could/might have done

将来：If… did/were/should do/were to do, ……would/should/could/might do

### 例句

1. 如果我处于你的境况，我会用一个更创新的方式处理这个问题。

   If I **had been** in your place, I **would have handled** the problem in a more creative way.

2. 如果你沉迷QQ游戏，会发生什么？

   What would happen if you **were addicted** to QQ games?

3. 如果她没有叫醒我的话，我就要睡过头了。

   If she **hadn't woken** me up, I **would have overslept**.

4. 如果我知道的话，我就加入你们的讨论了。

   If I **had known**, I **would have joined** in your discussion.

5. 如果你成功了，一切都会好起来。

   If you **should succeed**, everything **would be** all right.

## if虚拟的倒装：

### 句型公式

Were/Should/Had + 主语 + … (倒装句中没有if)

**只倒装从句，主句不倒装**

**只有从句的谓语含were, should, have时，从句才能倒装**

### 例句

1. If it were Sunday today, I would go there with you.

   = **Were it Sunday today**, I would go there with you.

2. If it hadn’t been for the free tickets, I wouldn’t have gone to the film so often.

   **Had it not been for the free tickets**, I wouldn’t have gone to the film so often.

3. If he were to leave today, he would be killed.

   **Were he to leave today**, he would be killed.

4. **Had you informed me earlier**, I wouldn' have signed the contract.

5. **Were I in good health**, I would go with you tomorrow.

6. What would have happened **had Bob walked farther**, as far as the river bank?

7. The business is risky. But **should we succeed**, we should be rich.

## 错综时间虚拟语气

条件状语从句中的动作与主句的动作发生时间不一致，这时动词形式应与各自所在句子中的时间状语或其所表达的意义相对应。

1. 如果你听了医生的话，你现在就好了。

   If you **had taken** the doctor’s advice, you **would be** well now.

2. 如果昨晚没看电视，我现在就不这么想要睡了。

   If I **hadn't watched** TV so late last night, I **wouldn’t be** so sleepy now.

3. 如果你早削减你的开支，现在你就不会欠债了。

   If you **had cut down** your expense earlier, you **wouldn't be in debt** now.

4. It is hard for me to imagine what I would be doing today if I **had not fallen** in love, at the age of seven, with the Melinda Library in my home town.

## 含蓄虚拟语气

句子中没有if，但也是虚拟的含义

常用词有：with, without, but for, otherwise, or, if it were not for(要不是因为)

1. With (= If I had) more money, I **could help** more people in need.

2. Without water, there **would be** no living things. = If it were not for water, there….

3. But for(=without) your help, we **couldn't have finished** the task in advance.

4. He hesitated for a moment, before kicking the ball, otherwise he **would have scored** a goal.

5. If it were not for the fact that Lucy *cannot* not sing, I **would have** invited her to the party.

   “Lucy cannot sing”是事实，不是虚拟，所以谓语不用虚拟。

注意：but/or引出的并列句中也可以引出虚拟语气和真实句，但它们引出的虚拟语气和真实句位置正好相反。

1. I would go with you, but I am busy now.

   = I am busy now, or I **would go** with you.

2. He **could have given** us more help, but he was too busy.

3. We returned two days ahead of time, otherwise we **would have been caught** in the sea wave.

关键在于分清楚哪一句是虚拟的，哪一句是真实的。



## 建议、命令、要求的虚拟语气

### 宾语从句中的虚拟语气

suggest/advice/recommend/propose/order/command/request/require/demand/insist that + 主语+(should) do...

1. He suggested that such a thing **(should) be prevented** from happening again.
2. Her mother insisted that she **go** out with a coat.  **should可以省略**
3. The workers demanded that their wages **be raised**.
4. The officer ordered the enemy **(should) be surrounded** in the village before daybreak.
5. If he **had insisted** that he **be sent** to have a further study in a university then, everything would go smoothly now.

It为形式宾语的情况也适用

1. I consider it vital that he **(should) think** deeply before acting.
2. We think it necessary that the meeting **(should) be** put off.

### 表语从句及同位语从句中的虚拟语气

suggestion/advice/order/demand….

1. My advice is that you **(should) send** for Doctor Li.
2. Do you know the order that the work **(should) be** started at once?
3. He made the suggestion that they **talk** in French.

### 主语从句的虚拟语气

主要体现在It做形式主语的三种情况： 

It’s + 过去分词 + that…

It’s + adj. + that…

It’s + n. + that…

常用的动词recommend, demand, desire, order, request, require, suggest, command

常用的形容词important, necessary, right, advisable, natural, strange, surprising, regretful, urgent, vital, insistent, essential

常用的名词duty, pity, no surprise, no wonder, shame, regret

其实这些词在句子中其实也有建议命令类似的的意思

1. It’s important that you **(should) take** the medicine.
2. It’s a pity that you **(should) refuse** the invitation.
3. It’s essential that we **(should) learn** some knowledge about fist aid.
4. It’s demanded that all the students **(should) go** to the playground. 
5. It was suggested that he **(should) join** the club activities.

### 某些词语如suggest, insist 等有双重含义，所以在使用的时候要注意什么时候用虚拟语气，什么时候不用虚拟语气。

1. suggest解释为“暗示”的时候不用虚拟语气

   Her smile suggested that she was in favor of the plan.

2. insist解释为“坚持认为”的时候不用虚拟语气

   We insisted that what the boy did was wrong.



## 虚拟语气在特殊句式中的运用

2. They would rather they hadn’t attended the party.

#### It’s (about) (high) time (that)… did/should do… 是该做…的时候了

从句中用did/should do，含建议的意思

= It’s high time for us to go home.

*表示语气很强时可以用How sb. wish+ clause，用法同上

1. as if/ though…. did/were(对现在的假设)
2. as if/ though…. could/would do(对将来的假设)
